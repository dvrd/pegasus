# Pegasus

A PEG parser for Odin. Basically a reimplementation of `@zyedidia's` [gpeg](https://github.com/zyedidia/gpeg)

Not cleaning anything atm, so wouldn't recommend it for serious things

You can find an example at `main.odin` right now. Will work on making it more practical to actually be useful for parsing. Rightnow the api is too verbose.

TODO: 
- [] Implement PEG grammar to allow creating grammars from strings
- [] Clean up unused data

To try it out: 
```
task run
```
